this test bank contains Glider test questions as well as coding questions.

Normally, there is one coding question to be solved. 

But there may be multiple coding questions with multiple choices.

Those are tagged accordingly.

Note that besides question-1, the order of the questions are arbitrary, and may not even show up at all during the test.
