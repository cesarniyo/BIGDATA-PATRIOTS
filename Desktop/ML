Exporation Data Analysis
*************************************
Loaded data using tools like pandas, python (connecting to the database) 
I used Descriptive statistic tools (such as count, min, max, average, standard deviation, skewness )for frequency claim description on sales data
I used correlation, regression, t-test to to infer the relationship between variables
I have used inferential statistical tool (such as p-value and confidence interval) for reseach  outcome data analysis
I used matplotlib and tableau for visualazation on different data dimension (1D, 2D and Aesthetics)






ML algorithms I worked with:
**************************************
Linear Regression
Logistic Regressions
Decision trees, Random forest
Adaboost, KNN,
SVMs, Neural Networks
K-means, Gaussian mixtures



ML projects completed:
**************************************
REGRESSION
-----------------
• I did the Exploration Data Analysis using Pandas
• visualized categorical and continous features using Matplotlib
• Preprocessed and cleaned data using Pandas functions
• Built a regression model using linear regression algorithm to predict customer purchasing behavior(monthly spending prediction)
• Validated the trained model using both Mean Square Error and histogram of residual metrics


CLASSIFICATION
-----------------
• I did the Explore Data Analysis using both Pandas
• performed both feature selection and feature engineering on training dataset
• Encoded categorical variables as binary dummy variables.
• Aggregated categories of categorical variables
• Performed the parameter tuning using Gradsearch algorithm
• Built a classification model using logistic regression algorithm to predict the customer likelihood of buying or not buying a product (86% of accuracy)
• Built a Credit Card Fraud detection model using Isolation forest algorithm.
• validated the model using both classification report and ROC

NLP
----------------
• Performed Name-Entity recognition using NLTK
• Build Twitter Sentiment classification model using transfer learning (LSTM / ULMFit) (80% accuracy)


BIG DATA MACHINE LEARNING (ON GOOGLE CLOUD with PYSPARK)
----------------
• Built and analyzed Regression model on google clound using PySpark
• Built customer bihaviour classification model using Random Forest algorithm within PySpark (with 83.3% of accuracy )


DEEP LEARNING
• Used TENSORFLOW to Buit deep learning model to predict type of appliances base on
given spectrograms of current and voltage measurements
(Images)
• Used FASTAI framework to build a DL model to classifier different design Faux Pas
   deployed app available on Play Store (NAMED: PlatformAI interior Design app)




Tools I use to build ML Models
